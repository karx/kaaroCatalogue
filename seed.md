## Project HLV

### Description
This project is an ecosystem of tools that help build, maintain, analyse and visualise a catalog.

The project would help build the catalog, by "researching" the web for content, and then "cataloging" it.
The project would help understand, plan, categorize and drive the catalog.
The project would help export and create a visualisation of the catalog.



Optional
* The project helps crowdsource the catalog.


### Architects Notes
All feature and tools are build as atomic actions/tools that can be exposed via an MCP (Model Context Protocol Tools)
The Visualisation is build as a web page.
* Has ability to explore and view the entire raw catalog, along with analyse and insights.
* The Insight page is the landing page which shows the information as per the insight navigation tool. 
* Each catalog has its own set of Visualiztion Components, that is required to visualise the catalog.
* The Explore page is the page which shows the raw catalog.
