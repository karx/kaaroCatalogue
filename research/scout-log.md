**Insight:** Identified a significant gap in the representation of contemporary Urdu poets (post-1950s) in the `poets-index.json`. The current catalog leans heavily towards classical and early modern poets.
**Action:** Enriched the catalog with 5 prominent contemporary Urdu poets: Jaun Elia, Parveen Shakir, Gulzar, Javed Akhtar, and Bashir Badr. Added their biographical details, major works, and awards. Validated data against Rekhta and Wikipedia.
